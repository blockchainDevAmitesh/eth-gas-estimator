## Introduction

EIP-1559 introduced a new fee structure for Ethereum, making gas fee estimation more predictable. This tool helps users estimate the total gas fees for their transactions by allowing them to input the base fee, priority fee (tip), and gas limit.

## Features

- Calculate gas fees using the EIP-1559 model
- Accepts user inputs for base fee, priority fee, and gas limit
- Outputs gas fees in both gwei and ETH

## How EIP-1559 Works

EIP-1559 includes three main components that affect gas fees:

- **Base Fee**: The minimum fee required to include a transaction in a block, which adjusts based on network demand.
- **Priority Fee (Tip)**: An optional fee to incentivize miners to prioritize your transaction.
- **Gas Limit**: The maximum amount of gas units a transaction can consume.

For more details, refer to the official [EIP-1559 documentation](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559).
